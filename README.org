Emacs editing utilities for Ncar Command Language(NCL).

* ncl.el
the original version is downloaded from the following link
http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/Files/ncl.el.

This repo was created to serve the el-get. Since I am using NCL mode
day to day I started modifying.  I am not maintainer of ncl.el. I sent
my changes to ncl-talk mailing list, unfortunately didn't get any
traction :(. So I am keeping them myself and for you.

* ncl-doc.el
ncl.el is mailnly modified to accommodate ncl-doc.el which is a
major/minor mode to help documentation lookup from ncl website.

The version was bumped up to v0.9x to separate from the original
version. if anyone finds my changes useful and find any bugs
please let me know.  TODO section has details about changes I plan to
implement.
* Installation & Setup
put ncl.el folder (which you downloaded) in emacs load path.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ncl.el.folder")
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\.ncl$" . ncl-mode) auto-mode-alist))
#+END_SRC

enable ncl-doc for ncl mode

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-hook 'ncl-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (require 'ncl-doc)
            (ncl-doc-minor-mode 1)))
#+END_SRC

you can also look at my configuration for ncl [[https://raw.github.com/yyr/emacsd/master/init-ncl.el][here]]

** Usage:
*** M-x ncl-doc-query-at-point ( C-c C-s )
This function does few things.
   1) It prompts for a string/keyword and collects a given string
   2) It tries to find a URL for the given string
      + if it finds URL for the string call the browser to open that URL
      + If no URL is found, then goes on to search for the given
        string.
      + Displays all search matches in separate buffer category wise.
        In that buffer RET in any search match will call browser for
        take you to that page.
      + If no matches found for a given string it leaves you there

*** M-x ncl-doc-query-open  ( C-c C-o )
Use this function you lets you choose from the all keywords ncl-doc
has in its database and takes you to that page.

To get an idea what ncl-doc does: here I loaded the ncl-doc.el then called
the function "ncl-doc-query-at-point" and given "add" string.

* ncl-ctags-gen.sh
one liner to generate ctags from NCL Source files; uses
~exuberant-ctags~
USAGE:
: ncl-ctags-gen.sh /path/to/ncl/files
if no arguments supplied it searches for ncl files in current
directory including sub directories

* Snippets for yasnippet
snippets folder contains ncl-mode snippets I have written.

* Setup:
put this in your .emacs
: (require 'ncl-doc)
: (add-hook 'ncl-mode-hook
:          (lambda ()
:            (ncl-doc-minor-mode 1)))

* Customization:
M-x customize-group RET ncl-doc RET
check out the following variables
 - `ncl-doc-url-base' = defaults to "http://www.ncl.ucar.edu"
   you can change this to any folder if you have downloaded the
   documentation from the NCL website and want read offline.
: (setq ncl-doc-url-base "file:///home/yagnesh/docs/ncl/")

Tip from NCL website FAQ:
:  Is there a way I can download the NCL website documentation so I
:  can access it locally on my machine?
:  TJ Onley pointed out this nice solution. For example, if you just want
:  to download the files under http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document, use:
:
:  wget -r -l0  -p -np -nH -k http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/
:
: This will create a directory called "Document", and in that directory,
: you can open the "index.shtml" file with your web browser and have
: access to all the files locally.
